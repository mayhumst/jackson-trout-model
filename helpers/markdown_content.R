# This file contains the text content of the attributions and the site description.
# These items are written and formatted using markdown language. See below for some common markdown formatting styles.

#
#       Text can be **bold** or *italicized.*
#
#       # This is a Header!
#       ## Here's a subheader...
#       ### ...And so on
#
#       Link to an external website like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
#       Or, link to a header so the user can jump somewhere else on the page: 
#       [the first header](#this-is-a-header) 
#       [the second sub-header](#heres-a-subheader)
#       [or the third](#and-so-on)
#       This can be helpful for a table of contents.
#
#       - This is
#       - a bulleted list
#           - with sub-bullets
#               - (indented by tabs)
#
#       1. The same can be done
#       2. with numerical lists. 
#           1. There are multiple ways
#           - to subindent lists.
#
#       Separate two sections with a horizontal line break using three hyphens.
#       ---
#       Like that!
#
#       If you want to separate two paragraphs with a newline,
#       you must use TWO carriage returns, 
#       not just
#       one. For example, this whole block of text will show up as 
#       one cohesive paragraph. 
#
#       However, this is a new, separate paragraph!
#
#       Alternatively, you can use a newline character. This is paragraph 1....\nThis is paragraph 2!
#
#       Demonstrate small chunks of code with `code blocks` inline with your text. 
#       For multiple lines of code, use three backticks instead. 
#       Be sure to specify the language; you can do this for any coding language, even shell code!
#       ```python
#       # Small python program
#       my_sum = 0
#       for i in range(1,6):
#           my_sum += i
#       print("Done!")
#       ```
#
